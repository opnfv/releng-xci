      "message": "You remove the venv to avoid installing ansible twice, true ? this mean the installer (OSA) ansible requires a version that will always be the same version as Bifrost. For OSA or Kolla, it is under the umbrella of Openstack, but for K8s or other, isn\u0027t it better to keep it inside the venv ?\n\nWas there a reason for ENABLE_VENV + USE_VENV ?",

      "message": "I do not completely understand. So the reason we had the bifrost ansible in VENV was to keep the system clean but that\u0027s pointless since we already install Ansible from pip to run XCI in the first place.\n\nSo even now, without this patch, k8s uses whatever Ansible XCI uses. That doesn\u0027t change after this patch. The only thing that changes is that bifrost uses the XCI\u0027s Ansible instead of its own.",
