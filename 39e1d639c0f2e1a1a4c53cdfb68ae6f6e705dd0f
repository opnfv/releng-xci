      "message": "I am wondering if you see any issue if we reduced the specs of opnfv vm, taking the total resource requirements lower like 2 cores and 4G of RAM.\n\nAnother thing I must mention is that, some scenarios such as os-nosdn-osm gets installed and run on opnfv vm, requiring more than what I suggested above. In this case, the scenario specific descriptor file can perhaps be used, assuming we will have a mechanism to allow overriding default opnfv pdf with the scenario specific one if it exists in scenario folder.\n\nWhat do you think?",
