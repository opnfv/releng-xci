      "message": "a general comment about sdf; again, if I am remembering it correctly, SDFs will be common across OPNFV like how we do for PDFs. This means that some of the scenarios or configuration of the scenarios might not be supported by all installers. I\u0027m not sure if we need to think about it now or leave it for later so just highlighting the historical thinking. It might not be possible to achieve common SDFs and we might end up with installer specific SDFs like how we did with IDF.",

      "message": "I was thinking about it, but scenarios are more \u0027agnostic\u0027 than IDF. Since IDF is basically an installer thing, we can potentially embed extra information there in order to make the SDF as generic as possible (this of course still allows installers to interpret an SDF the way they want to).",
