      "message": "these are all seem still WIP. We shouldn\u0027t be doing stuff just for Debian. We also have a central place were the ansible version can be set as a default option. Finally, as said in a previous patchset, it seems we need a way to set the VM/BM distro to be independent of the host. Trying to re-use OS_FAMILY is a bit problematic so that needs to be fixed in a separate and independent patchset",

Distros expert have some parameters to fill up.\n\nAs answered in a previous patchset, it is possible to have BM/VM independent from the host, that is why i use OS_FAMILY\u003d${OS_FAMILY:-$ID}, to set it from Jenkins or manually, but use the jumphost distro if not set.",
